## About

I am a mathematical scientist working on applied mathematics,
scientific computing, and modeling. My interests include numerical
analysis, PDEs, inverse problems, and data‑driven methods.

I focus on bridging mathematical theory with computational practice,
with applications in physics and engineering.
